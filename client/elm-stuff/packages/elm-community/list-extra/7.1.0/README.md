Pull requests are welcome. You can expect some kind of response within 5 days.

If you are adding a new function please..

0. Include [documentation](http://package.elm-lang.org/help/documentation-format) and make sure it has a code snippet demonstrating what the function does.
1. Give a detailed use case where your function would come in handy in the PR.
2. Add tests to `Tests/Tests.elm`

If you are improving existing functions please demonstrate the performance gains in something like [Ellie](https://ellie-app.com/) and by using a benchmark library like [this one](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/BrianHicks/elm-benchmark/latest).
